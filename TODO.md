* Add dependencies
Maybe have commit messages require other dependencies?

#depends: <CHANGE-ID>

and then recursively grab the dependencies? seems like a lot of process, since
everyone would need to put the #depends: in their commit messages.




* find which docker/git and use full path

* verify that docker can be used without sudo

* clean up git branches!!

* switch to original branch when done EVEN ON FAILURE

* print out docker ps info? can we even do this? maybe add color. only in daemon mode?

* build&deploy only with -D

* daemon mode with -d

* verbose with -v
