* Add dependencies
Maybe have commit messages require other dependencies?


#depends: <CHANGE-ID>


and then recursively grab the dependencies? seems like a lot of process, since
everyone would need to put the #depends: in their commit messages.




* parse the UCD install dir from the dockerfile
it is already the top comment
